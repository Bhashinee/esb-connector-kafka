## The Kafka connector
The Kafka [connector](https://docs.wso2.org/display/ESB500/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [Kafka 
Producer API](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerapi) through WSO2 ESB, and acts as a message producer 
that facilitates publishing messages. The Kafka connector creates a connection to Kafka, and sends messages to Kafka brokers. 

Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that maintains feeds of messages in topics. Producers write
 data to topics and consumers read from topics. For more information on Apache Kafka, see [Apache Kafka 
 documentation](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html). 

## Getting started
To get started with the connector, go to [Configuring Kafka](config.md) Operations. Once you have completed your 
configurations, you can start publishing messaged to Kafka brokers.

##Additional information
For general information on using connectors and their operations in your ESB configurations, see [Using a Connector](http://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB500/Using+a+Connector).
